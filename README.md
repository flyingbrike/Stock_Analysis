For the stocks entered by the user, the program calculates the covariance(how related the stocks are to each other, value of 0 meaning no relation, and a postive number indicating a postive relation in the same direction) and correlation(a standardized value of the direction and strength between the stocks, its is measured between [-1, +1] ) between the stocks.
